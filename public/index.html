<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>
Improve the elderlys' ability to age at home through understanding of daily activities inferred from passive sensor analysis.
<h2>
How it Works
</h2>
<p>
The need for helping elderly individuals or couples remain in their home is increasing as our global population ages.  Cognitive processing offers opportunities to assist the elderly by processing information to identify opportunities for caregivers to offer assistance and support.
<p>
Rather than depending on sensors worn on the body (and needing to be not forgotten, recharged, etc..) or installing sensors on individual devices (e.g. sink, cabinet, refrigerator, etc..), this solution utilizes passive monitoring devices, notably video camera(s) with multi-channel microphones, to sense activity, record events, and build a model of normative behavior.
<p>
<img width="75%" src="images/basic-scenario.png">
<table>
<tr valigh="top">
<td>
<figure> <img width="90%" src="images/camera.png"> <figcaption>Installation on kitchen shelf</figcaption></figure>
</td>
<td width="70%">
Initially we intend to monitor the kitchen and recognizes the presence of a person (not an individual) in the room. From this simple event detection we will build a normative baseline of daily activity and detect when that daily activity exhibits aberrations (e.g. no activity in kitchen after +2 std. dev. past median time).
The visual recognition algorithm will run on the local device (e.g. RaspberryPi with camera), the issues of round-trip latency to the cloud, or bandwidth required, or security or privacy concerns, will be eliminated.  Only events generated from this recognition will be sent to the cloud to build (and update) the normative behavior model.
This initial scenario may be easily extended to other passive monitoring capabilities, e.g. audio, motion (sonar), electrical circuit, , ... as well as deployment in other area, e.g. entry way, bathroom, hallway, etc.. to provide support for additional scenarios, e.g. medication adherence, diet, exercise, ...

<h2>System Overview</h2>
<p>
The solution is patterned on a "do-it-yourself" (DIY) approach and utilizes inexpensive hardware, open source software, and free services from the IBM BlueMix cloud.  The local device is comprised of a RaspberryPi computer and PlayStation3 Eye USB camera with four (4) internal microphones.  Total cost of hardware is under US$80 on-line.
<br>
<img width="75%" src="images/system-overview.png">
<p>
The <a href="http://www.bluemix.net/">IBM BlueMix</a> cloud provides a suite of services for the application, including this Web site, which is a Node.js CloudFoundry application.
The BlueMix environment enables this application context to apply to other services, 
notably the IBM Watson <a href="http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/visual-recognition.html">image recognition services</a>.  
In addition, the <a href="http://cloudant.com/">Cloudant</a> NoSQL repository stores the historical event and image recognition information.
<p>
BlueMix also provides the <a href="http://www.ibm.com/software/data/dashdb/">dashDB</a> hybrid relational data warehousing service.  
This service automatically replicates from the Cloudant repository and provides an SQL interface for SELECT, PROJECT and JOIN.
This SQL services can also be consumed by <a href="http://watson.analytics.ibmcloud.com">Watson Analytics</a> and other third-party software packages from IBM 
and business partners (e.g. <a href="http://www.looker.com">Looker</a>).
<p>
Also on BlueMix, the IBM <a href="https://internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/">Internet of Things</a> platform and 
associated <a href="https://iotrti-prod.mam.ibmserviceengage.com/">Real-Time Insights</a> provide device registration and system status monitoring for the RaspberryPi.
General purpose conditionals can be applied for integration with email, <a href="http://www.ifttt.com">IFTTT</a>, Node.Red and arbitrary web-hook.
<p>
In addition, this site utilizes Mixpanel (www.mixpanel.com) and Intercom.io (www.intercom.io) to provide user tracking and near-line chat
(n.b. look in lower right corner for chat icon).
<h2>
Training
</h2>
<p>
This project started utilizing the AlchemyAPI (http://www.alchemyapi.com/) recognition algorithm and then was extended to include the VisualInsights recognition algorithm.
The AlchemyAPI demonstrated a low signal to noise ratio, with most images being classified as "NO_TAG," indicating that none of the known objects were identified; 
in addition, the algorithm only returned a single result.
<p>
The VisualInsights algorithm was made available as beta in December 2005, and I added its analysis capabilities to augment the signal; the VisualInsghts algorithm returns up to twenty-five (25)
objects per call; the additional objects the VI algorithm could identify was a great benefit, but the signal, while improved, still included signifcant noise; specifically in the 
identification of "humans" being split across various classifications and without any hierarchical organization into groups.
<p>
Sadly, first the VisualInsights algorithm was deprecated in June 2016 and in 2017 the AlchemyAPI will also cease to operate.  The new algorithm, Watson VisualRecognition, 
is the child of AlchemyAPI and VisualInsights with support for multiple entities per image, as well as a default classifier generating poor signal and still significant noise (n.b. there is now
a hierarchy, but neither the classes nor the hierarchy is published and must be discovered from results).
<p>
Therefore, I embarked on building a training loop for whatever recognition algorithm I might utilize.  This loop would capture the images from the camera's local storage (n.b. uSD card) and
present those images to the application user community (e.g. elderly individual/couple) and enable manual classification for subsequent training, testing, and deploying of a model specific to both this application context (i.e. people detection) as well as the local environs (e.g. room location, dogs, cats, residents, ...)
<h3>
Labeling the images
</h3>
<p>
Below is the user-interface for labeling images.  Options are available as buttons (e.g. person, kitchen, dog, ..) based on previous labels assigned; new labels can be added in the text entry box and the 
image's initial (AlchemyAPI) classification and capture date are shown.
<figure>
<img src="images/label-web-app.png" width="90%">
<figcaption>Simple Web application to label images</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Ideally, images are labeled if and only if the image contains the entity in question, e.g. a person, and does not contain any of the other entities of interest (e.g. dog or cat).
The training set also requires negative examples which do not include <i>any</i> entity (i.e. person, dog or cat).
To achieve this distinction, each camera installation has been pre-defined to a corresponding label (e.g. "kitchen") that is used to identify the negative examples.
Similarly, other locations may also be suitably classified (e.g. bathroom, dining room, living room, ...)
<h3>
Learning the classifiers
</h3>
<p>
The Watson VisualRecognition image classifier provides both for initial learning as well as updates with new images.  The API does not provide details on images utilized in training for
either positive or negative examples so an independent record of images utilized must be maintained.  In addition, no standard of practice is defined for validating or measuring the quality
of the learned model, so independent testing and quality measurement must be constructed.  Finally, as the training process appears to be a required constiuent component, 
other entities (e.g. myself, my wife, my kids, ..) could also be identified and used to train Watson VR.
<p>
The training set is limited to 100 megabytes (MB) of data for each class with a total maximum of 430 MB; minimum number of labeled images is ten (10). Updates can be made against a single
labeled set at a time, also including negative examples (i.e. not including any previously labeled entities).
<p>
Each learned model is referred to by both a name as well as a specific identifier.  The name is being utilized for the device (e.g. rough-fog) and the identifier determines the model and serves
as an index to keep track of which images have been used for training purposes -- both positive and negative examples.  The script is still in process <a href="https://github.com/dcmartin/age-at-home/blob/master/bin/train_vr"><code>train_vr</code></a>.
<h2>
Analysis
</h2>
<p>
With several weeks of data collected patterns are emerging.  Initial analysis step was to understand the classsifiers tagged in the images.
<h3>
Step 1: Watson Analytics
</h3>
<p>
Data was processed from JSON in Cloudant into CSV files for each device.  Resulting data included listing of all classifiers by fifteen (15) minute interval per day.
<ul>
<li> <a href="data/rough-fog-all-intervals.csv">All classifiers by interval for rough-fog</a>
<li> <a href="data/damp-cloud-all-intervals.csv">All classifiers by interval for damp-cloud</a>
</ul>
<p>
These images are created using <a href="https://watson.analytics.ibmcloud.com/">Watson Analytics</a>.  It is simple to get a free account and load the CSV files.
Import these CSV files into Watson Analytics, refine the data model and explore yields the following graphical displays of the classifier space.
<p>
<table width="100%">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30%" align="center">

    <a href="images/classifier-heatmap.png"><img width="95%" src="images/classifier-heatmap.png"></a>

    <figcaption>Relationship between hour, day and classifier</figcaption>

</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
The heatmap of classifiers as well as the primary classifiers across hour of day were both highly informative.  This insight lead the selection of the following classifiers 
from the VisualInsights recognition algorithms for further investigation using Looker.
<h3>
Step 2: Looker
</h3>
<p>
Analysis of the underlying events which generated the classifications lead to analysis using Looker.  Looker generates SQL for the dashDB replicant of the Cloudant JSON event history 
and then makes that output available for visualization and download as JSON.  The following graphics are "live" views of the rough-fog and damp-cloud events.

</figure>
<p>
As can be seen in the graphs below, the default classifier for the AlchemyAPI produces very little signal with the majority of events being classifed as "NO_TAGS" indicating nothing was recognized.

<h3>
Step 3: Excel
</h3>
<p>
The same UNIX script 
(<code><a href="bin/mkclass">mkclass</a></code>)
that converts the Cloudant JSON into CSV files suitable to Watson Analytics is also suitable 
for consumption by Excel.
The script builds the classifier (or classifier set, e.g. 'people') population statistics model for the specified device.
The results are processed in the <a href="data/rough-fog-person.xslx">Excel spreadsheet</a> to produce the charts below.
<ol>
<li>All Activity; the sum of 'person' events in the kitchen
<li>Expected Activity; when 'person' count by 'intervals' "near" mean of interval count
<li>Over Activity; when 'person' count by 'interval' is +2SD over mean of interval count
<li>Under Activity; when 'person' count by 'interval' is -2SD under mean of interval count
</ol>
<table>

</tr>
</table>
<h2>
Step 4: Web Services
</h2>
With analytical understanding of the event classifier space and corresponding activity for specific classifiers by day of week and interval of day,
a model can now be constructed to determine the average time of first activity in the AM.  That model is calculated on the server, based on the historical 
event data and supplied to the device on demand through a Web service.
The Web service is a HTTP address with parameters that invokes logic to to return a result, e.g. the average score for Person in a given interval of time.
<p>
Below are some examples of the <code>aah-stats</code> Web service:
<ul>
<li>
Calculates / updates statistical model for device and classifier
<a href="http://www.dcmartin.com/CGI/aah-stats.cgi?db=rough-fog&id=person"><code>aah-stats?db=rough-fog&id=person</code></a>
<li>
Calculates / updates statistical model for days of week or device and classifier
<a href="http://www.dcmartin.com/CGI/aah-stats.cgi?db=rough-fog&id=person&day=all"><code>aah-stats?db=rough-fog&id=person&day=all</code></a>
<li>
Calculates / updates statistical model for intervals of day for device and classifier
<a href="http://www.dcmartin.com/CGI/aah-stats.cgi?db=rough-fog&id=person&interval=all"><code>aah-stats?db=rough-fog&id=person&interval=all</code></a>
<li>
Calculate / update list of all classifiers for device (e.g. "db=rough-fog")
<a href="http://www.dcmartin.com/CGI/aah-classifiers.cgi?db=rough-fog"><code>aah-classifiers</code></a> 
</ul>
The id= argument can be specified with any of the classifiers.  The day= and interval= arguments can be specified with &quot;all&quot; or a number for day (0-6) or interval (0-95).
<p>
<img width="75%" src="images/command-line.png">
<p>
This information is consumed by the RaspberryPi and utilized to compare current events with the historical population statistics.
Local conditional testing is currently in-progress, utilizing the <code>motion</code> package capability for additional event processing.

<h2>Infrastructure</h2>
We are making use of <a href="http://resin.io/">resin.io</a> to manage the build and deployment process to the Raspberry Pi devices.
<p>
The resin.io service provides a customizable base image with which to "flash" the uSD card for the RaspberryPi.  The image may be configured 
with the SSID and password for the local WiFi network.
<p>
The "AgeAtHome" application we have defined provides a context in which devices participate.  Each device is assigned to one application.
Once a device has been flashed and booted, it connects to the resin.io service and presents itself within the application context.

Changes were made to both Dockerfile as well as initial script to enable IoTF/QS and sample C program only sends system status.  Will need to change
the sample program to progres HTTP requests to send any JSON payloads (i.e. our events).
<h3>
IBM IOTF Real-time Insights
</h3>
The IBM IOTF Real-time Insights capabilities can be linked to the IOTF Platform 
through a shared repository for the JSON events received by the platform; the JSON objects in that repository provide schemas for payload processing.
The IOTF-RTI environment provides for rules to be specified in conjunction with JSON
payload values using numeric comparison to static values, other payload values, and context parameters (n.b. unsure where or how these values are set).
